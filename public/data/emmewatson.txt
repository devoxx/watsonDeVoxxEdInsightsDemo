alright guys arm welcome to this initial quickie on not the spring roadmap actually half a full length session on mother more than talent component design with me here coming up right afterwards %HESITATION which is going to be a more extensive discussion of tea at the sign behind %HESITATION the spring from a component model and some of the more recent features the available in current versions offspring such a design discussion the source code based design discussion you're highly welcome to I want to go there in this short presentation I'm going to take care just a couple of minutes to us discuss both what we've done very recently and what we intend to do over the next %HESITATION well twelve to eighteen months really so in all brevity %HESITATION this is some of the year a decent I'm off there focus topics in spring from a foot or two this is already available went GA and the through line we're currently working to what's for the two to three plenty of stuff in there so %HESITATION in spring from Nick we tend to have a future releases off a very M. rich contact so a for that wonderful to to a four to three release actually brings a lot of features onto the table witha actually more than you would sketched out a for a major releases in in in some other projects it's just a version terminology that we're using so even a foot to for example we have support for default methods across the framework now we detect annotated jumps eightfold methods we are half a face rich event listener model with her a method called excellent annotated event method model enough for the two now with all the ring with an option to combine it with a synchronous execution everything %HESITATION you woods would expect to be possible incrimination without a spring we spent significant effort on a revision of our imitation Elias model at our composable imitation model where you were able to combine %HESITATION out of the box annotations in spring into custom annotations of your own arm and there's a lot of flexibility now and how you can express I ask you to attribute references between your limitations and to the spring annotations that you're using more on that in my modern Java component design %HESITATION session afterwards D. era support the chase a free five four is a little bit ahead of its time but we took the opportunity to support the monetary amount type and the currency can you type in three five four outside the box so if you're using spring data binding and you happen to be one of the early adopters of chase a three five four Anna anything will work out of the box for you as you expect right just use monetary amount bind to a trend that out a we were trying to naturally follow %HESITATION the rules there of Jeffrey for for for the money and currency types just like you already use to for Joe the time and judicata travel time seem kind of rules apply we have significant improvements in the web space which is the second coffee right so %HESITATION de they're supposed across original requests and in particular the revision of our HTTP cash handling a mighty strong enough reasons on on their own top grateful to to we also have a support for can for streaming of responses and serve a sentence in particular so is this your support first class in the spring NBC handler method and point I'm previously you could do this quite easily yourself but it wasn't very expressive very first class now you actually able to return in essence E. emitter from a spring NBC handle a method and the frame of treats it for you we have support for javascript based web views which actually goes along with a revision of day at use a two to three supporting for spring which is the scripting engine scripting abstraction we are %HESITATION support in particular netfinity Java eight javascript engine in particular but that's of course generally usable with any other scripting provider right and %HESITATION DH immigrant integration is a special purpose topic in the web space oops yeah well it's kind of inverted unfortunately a heftier emissions mixed up little here but actually not too bad we have a spring from a four to three coming and I'm already let Mary see at this point this is the last JDK six and seven compatible released you can expect to come out of her spring that spring from a four to three is the last for that XP chip before the next feature release there's not going to be for that for and the next thing we're working towards a spring from Pfeiffer though which is as we would I'm going to mention in a second it's going to be just eight based so spring from a four to three he's a spring for feature release has the same system requirements works and six seven eights and even early sections nine as for the two of us right now and works and civic contain a spec to civic to the five plus you can use it on what's his seven and Tom could sixteen even for next year's offspring from for the three for the freeze plan to have an open and extended open source support life a little bit like spring from a three to two that ex right now and we already working to which are free to sixteen and the %HESITATION the idea is that if your rigidity six or seven user or just happy with your existing spring frame Mickey was a genial talk environment spring from four to three is what you're supposed to operate to because that's the one with the extended support life for the two will only have regular support until four threes out plus a few months as we recently have is a policy before the three is going to be supported until the two thousand nineteen easily so what's plant there are quite a bit of stuff it's actually been alone a lot of for her IPS combined for small of refinements in the dependency injection model terror some some ideas some things you cannot do yet %HESITATION constructors and configuration classes automatically consider at construct all too wide if it's the only one that he McKay to cut a class %HESITATION there a couple of ideas we also exploring which kinds of convenience annotations we could be shipping in addition to the ones that we already have %HESITATION but most a few notations that we ship right now are basically building blocks they can be combined semantically combines pa and it could even be combined out of the box so we're wondering whether we're supposed to ship out of the box coping annotations prebuilt request session scope imitations instead of leaving it up to you to specify is coping with that scope we already have a precomposed sanitation which is at risk control them if you ever bumped into that one which is a combination of a spring at controller and point indicator and point stereotype and add yet responsible you notice to %HESITATION consider return strings from Hindemith it's as bodies to be turned interest response this is the kind of way we're going so imagine just out of the box combinations of certain things you can already express in a natural way with an opportunity to find a good name for it so custom annotations composed imitations of this kind even if we ship them in particular keep them out of the box we have an opportunity to find a good name for it and I suppose some of those could be very commonly used in practice and we have a are a couple of integration upgrades coming on you ever since well action not new versions were compatible with the latest in Jackson chest but reports hive an intensive already but more like a baseline upgrades we're going to raise the minimum in little easing some of our integration allowing us to avoid the use of deprecated methods suffering from a for the threes and important wrecked up releasing the full decks line %HESITATION but it's actually opened for %HESITATION communitarian I straight if there's anything you would really like to see in spring from afforded XTO by all means now is the time to raise it we are in the process of defining selecting the concrete spring from a for the three future targets and will create the actual for the three branch and start to work toward snapshots there in December so it's open for feature requests to some degree right as much as we can deal with until cute too so sorry for the %HESITATION miscible fix it this way next up to spring from a five and %HESITATION spring from at five eighteen to to be released towards the end of next year cure for next year because it's supposed to follow chicken nine so central topic is comprehensive chicken on support to the degree that we can right we're going to do everything we can to support the module arrangement are we going to do everything we can to support in you itching to pick client if it actually makes it into chicken nine %HESITATION we already testing on the latest you can nine snapshot so there's the actual runtime compatibility is already there and spring from four to two with in particular began for the three this is about please it first class support for new chicken ninth which not just tolerating chicken on at runtime but rather embracing it at the same time we're going to raise the baseline to JDK eight plus requiring Kitty Kate plus across the framework allowing us to use Java eight source code style all across our own code base a very important enabler we can use defaults methods Jerry default methods in our own API NSK I interfaces we can use land isn't and I think it's important important step to take to prepare for food innovation to follow and to ease our maintenance are in Fife that ex feature in these they're a couple of aspects that rich wrecking at you suffered a revision plants that's the Java expert on expert inject package which wrecking civic for that though we are tracking stuff that's happening in the Jamison shake their space well we already have existing support in spring pretty rich support and spring we might chip in support for this in fact it already looks like we actually going to be ahead of those specs so arm some of the actual GE support might following a five that one then but we are known for doing things as ileus technically possible so we might already to some of this that %HESITATION we have a pretty strong HDP two story when we already starting this we are working on some things now are ready %HESITATION we can already you spring from a full to two with chatting on the three and using it should be to there so we we are trying to embrace it should be to enable to whip containers webservice very early this is going to continue in Fife the chicken nine that you typically HTTP clients and just the general focus on character HDP to use between clients and service everything we can possibly do to make that happen arm will will also make it into five todo it least if we can to for free to some degree anything reactive web architecture this is a treaty central topic in its own right the %HESITATION I deres that in spring five we are should the course bring reactive mode you we further support for reactive streams out of the box it's a spring NBC like endpoint arrangement souls it looks like syntactically very analogous to a spring NBC endpoint model but you're actually working on a reactive engine running on that too are currently there's a prototype already he %HESITATION %HESITATION spring reactive project on github that's going to be decomposed into a spring from a five feature theme arm where we do allow you to have finished EP enabled web ok I am a rich to flee enabled web architecture where in in you in terms of what you're interacting with you know that you're living in Iraq before old you can return publishes you you can do things in the natural reactive style it is not about trying to edit spring NBC as it is onto a reactive engine it's about taking the Spring MBC syntax and development experience and having a separate but similar endpoint model running on the reactive engine underneath there's also going to be some reactive core support all over the framework where abstractions that we have already will he opened up to support %HESITATION back pressure and the the end result ideally of course is to allow for completely reactive processing callpath from DHCP endpoint down to the data store and pick up so it was a tracking what's happening with the MongoDB and posts Chris drivers and those things make most sense if you can use them of course in combination with %HESITATION out reactive diesel trucks the idea is that you're not necessarily building a fully rectification you might have a microcytic his arrangement where some of the Marcus if this would really benefit from a reactive processing arranged does you will be clear then build with the spring five reactive endpoint model and %HESITATION the reciprocation many parts of the system might actually work in the more traditionally oriented processing architecture that's perfectly okay he might not microcytic this arrangement democracy vs is movement allows you to combine basically the best of those morals %HESITATION for different purposes sticky building a mycosis for so it's not an it it's not about all or nothing it's not an ideological arrangement where you're not supposed to do everything react to flee it's about opting into reactive ness in places where you actually benefit from it with a very familiar and they're like a syntactic endpoint model that feels like a spring component model to you we can translate many of your assisting and of a few existing understanding spring component models just right there and to allow you to do things correctly he need to alright well a so much really for the purposes of the quickie took thirty seconds left %HESITATION so next up is for two three and we're working on that right now coming next week fold spring for mac for the three which have discussed before last for the next featureless coming the target is in may twenty sixteen and spring from a five to dole more loosely plans towards %HESITATION the fourth quarter like in the next year based on on the thing that I've outlined thanks for your attention feel free to join you for more than Telecomunicaciones took in ten minutes but in some other room if I remember correctly thanks
